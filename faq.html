                <div>
                    The frequency of detailing depends on factors such as your driving habits, environmental conditions, 
                    and personal preferences. As a general guideline, we recommend detailing your vehicle every 4 to 6 months
                    to maintain its appearance and protect its surfaces.

                <div> 
                    The duration of a detailing service depends on factors such as the size
                    and condition of the vehicle, as well as the specific services requested. 
                    As a rough estimate, most detailing appointments range from 2 to 6 hours,
                    but we can provide a more accurate timeframe upon evaluation of your vehicle.
